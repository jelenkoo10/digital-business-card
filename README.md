# Digital Business Card

A page which shows some basic information about me and is designed to look like a business card. It is built with React, and it's a static page that consists of four components: Info, About, Interests and Footer. It's been made as Solo project on [Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) and it's first React Solo project there.
